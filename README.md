# Partly Windy

A weather app powered by the very latest in machine learning technology.

## TL;DR

We're gonna make a Flutter app that leverages OpenAI text completion to give us the weather
forecasts. No more messing with rain gages and those spinning wind speed gadgets, we are going
to get our weather forecasts right from the burning heart of computer science achievement,
machine learning. It will go great. Don't worry.

## Forecasting the Weather

For many thousands of years, humans have tried all kinds of zany ways to predict the weather. In ye
olden days, people relied on lore and superstition to predict the weather. They looked at cloud
patterns, patterns in the stars, patterns in the colors at sunset, lunar phase patterns, and all
kinds of other patterns besides. Really, people just had a great zeal for implying causation from
correlation when it came to weather forecasting.

Today, of course, we predict the weather from patterns in massive datasets. Using science and
technology, modern weather forecasting is actually quite accurate. Forecasting the weather involves
a truly amazing range of scientific instruments, record-keeping, number crunching, and modeling.
Predicting the weather is big business as well, with the value of the whole industry making its way
towards $2 billion annually. There is even a whole government agency dedicated to weather-related
services, regulations, and products. Peppered all across the United States are more than 180,000
weather stations that collect mind-paralyzing amounts of data to be fed into climate models.
Forecasting the weather is a really bonkers endeavor.

## Using AI for That (/s)

Here's the thing though, why don't we just use AI for that? Machine learning, or, popularly,
artificial intelligence is constantly being held up as the culmination of all human achievement,
or so it sometimes seems. Machine learning is constantly being touted as the solution for all manner
of different issues. Don't like driving your car? Make the AI do that. Don't like typing things into
your smartphone? Make the AI listen to queries. Don't like shopping? Make the AI tell you what you
want to buy. Don't like paying call center employees? Make the AI talk to your customers, they
will love it!

So, today we are going to unleash machine learning to make a whole new group of employed people
redundant: weather scientists and TV personalities. Why bother with all that scientific gadgetry,
data collection, and mathematics when we can just make the AI give us the weather forecast? For
the low, low cost of some data center CPU cycles we can just get a weather forecast from the latest
and  greatest in NLP technologies. For the price of your typical weather radar station, we can hit
machine learning API endpoints pretty much forever.

Sure, the accuracy of our weather forecasts might suffer a little; after all, the ability for AI
systems today to deliver actually accurate and truthful information is, without wanting to
put too fine a point on it, total shit. But we can stand to give up a little accuracy if it means
we can put the words "artificial intelligence" in our marketing material.
